  <div class="box">Brothers Malcolm and Angus Young might be larger-than-life, but in person, it's a bit of a different story. Older brother Malcolm is the taller of the two, at only 5-foot-3. Angus stands all of 5-foot-2 (via Ultimate Classic Rock), and there's a pretty heartbreaking reason for their small stature: Lead pipes contaminated the drinking water on the Glasgow housing estate they lived in.</div>

  <div class="box">The Scotsman says the last straw came in 1963. The winter was the worst in recorded history, burying the countryside under snow and ice as temperatures plunged into the subzero range. Sunny Australia started looking pretty good, so the Youngs signed up for a government program designed to encourage immigration to Oz.</div>

  <div class="box">That's the family's story, says the Sydney Morning Herald, and that's just a peek into how bleak their childhood in Scotland really was. The brothers — along with their parents and a pack of siblings — had an early childhood shaped by the perpetual unemployment of their father and seemingly endless poverty.</div>

  <div class="box"> For just the price of two adult, one-way tickets — discounted to just £10 each — they packed up and headed off. When they got there, they started at the very, very bottom. The family found themselves living in the tin shelters of a migrant hostel, and music really did save them when older brother George and his band, The Easybeats, put out a song that became Australia's first international rock hit, Friday on My Mind.</div>
