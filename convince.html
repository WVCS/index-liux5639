      <p class = "textdec">The notes on a piano are laid out most intuitively, serving as the best introductory way to learn music. It doesn't require tuning from the student and provides accurate sounds. Students would have an easier time picking up sheet music and music theory. Playing the piano gives improved coordination skills for younger students, helping to strengthen their hand reflexes and mind. These benefits could lead to improved musical performance and academic test scores. Learning to play the piano first may be the most beneficial for transitioning into string and woodwind instruments. Traditional instruments like the Guzheng from China and the West African kora would be easier to pick up after gaining basic music knowledge and coordination skills. </p>

    <p>Playing the piano doesn't have much physical discomfort unless the student's technique or posture is incorrect. Instruments like the bass (string) need to be physically supported by the musician and are painful to play for even 30 minutes. A great deal of exertion is needed to make a proper sound on the bass. Years of playing can end up in the growing of the spine and backbones to one side of the lower back.

   <div class = "textposition3">
   <p>Other instruments like the Guzheng require the musician or student to put on nails before playing and are especially painful and taxing on the hands. Practicing for a violin performance may require long periods of standing with an instrument balanced between the head and shoulders. Woodwind instruments like the flute, clarinet, oboe, bassoon, and saxophone require significant mastery of breath control and a great deal of force and energy. Woodwind instruments like the saxophone are very difficult to pick up and learn well. </p>

    <h1 class = "textdec2">Easy-to-master Techniques</h1>
    <p>Some techniques on the violin include vibrato and spiccato, both of which are extremely difficult to play well when incorporated into some repertoire. </p>
    <p>Some argue that the piano is very hard to master and difficult to bring out the artistry but it's also an instrumental instrument to understand as a musician. The piano is generally a better and more useful tool down the road and provides a solid foundation for any instrument.</p>
